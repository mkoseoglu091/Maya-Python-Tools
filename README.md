 Simple Python Tools for Maya

 I am making these in an effort to learn how Python is used within Maya.

## Tools

#### 1. Object Rename
Adds a suffix to all visible objects in the scene. If selected=True is provided to the rename function, only the selected objects are renamed.

#### 2. Gear Creator
When an instance of gear class is generated, the user can create a new gear geometry specifying the number of teeth and length of them. Once the geometry is created, the user can modify these values as well.
